getattr(object, 'x') is completely equivalent to object.x
There's only in two reasons to use it:

you can't write object.x, because you don't know in advance which attribute you want (it comes from a string). very useful for meta-programming.
you want to provide a default value. object.y will raise an AttributeError if there's no y. But getattr(object, 'y', 5) will return 5.
