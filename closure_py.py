"""
Closure: a Closure is inner function which remembers and has accees to variables in the local scope
in which it was created. even outer function has finished executing.
"""

"""
When and why to use Closures:

    1. As closures are used as callback functions, they provide some sort of data hiding. 
        This helps us to reduce the use of global variables.
    2. When we have few functions in our code, closures prove to be efficient way. 
        But if we need to have many functions, then go for class (OOP).



ADVANTAGE : Closures can avoid use of global variables and provides some form of data hiding.
(Eg. When there are few methods in a class, use closures instead).

Also, Decorators in Python make extensive use of closures.
