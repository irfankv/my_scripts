git commit -m "message"

git remote add origin "url"    or git remote add myrepo "url"

Compare two branches using git diff
In order to compare two branches easily, you have to use the “git diff” command and provide the branch names separated by dots.

$ git diff branch1..branch2

Compare commits between two branches
In some cases, you may be interested in knowing the commit differences between two branches.

In order to see the commit differences between two branches, use the “git log” command and specify the branches that you want to compare.

$ git log branch1..branch2

Compare specific file between two branches
In some cases, you may want to see all changes done to a specific file on the current branch you are working on.


In order to see the differences done to a file between two branches, use the “git diff” command, specify the two branches and the filename.

$ git diff master..feature -- <file>
